// What a frame carries at its fullest, counted against the Pico's sixteen, the

// refuses more than 16 all the same, so 16 is used everywhere). The settings
// panel is modal, and the frame a modal opens sheds the bar furniture, so the
// two never land in one frame together. With the panel open the clock strip
// over it is always up, and a step button under the ray takes the hover ring a
// cell would. The toast can land on any of these, one layer more.
//   Screen tab: the glow, both eyes, the stats, the cog button, the panel,
//     the clock, six thumbs, the hover ring, ray and cursor: 16. With the
//     screen locked to the head head aim's two rows are live, two thumbs more
//     and the strip of values beside them: 19, three past.
//   Room tab, in a room where it takes the screen tab's place: the room, the
//     glow, both eyes, the stats, the cog button, the panel, the clock, the
//     strip of percents, two rings on its rows of cells and the hover ring,
//     three thumbs, ray and cursor: 17, one past.
//   Display tab in a room: its choices are one strip rather than a ring a
//     row, so the room, the glow, both eyes, the stats, the cog button, the
//     panel, the clock, the marks, the hover ring, the glow level's thumb,
//     ray and cursor: 14.
//   3D tab in a room: the rings on its preset and its switch, the hover ring
//     and two thumbs over the same: 16.
//   Picture tab in a room: the room, the glow, both eyes, the stats, the cog
//     button, the panel, the clock, the strip of values, four thumbs, the
//     hover ring, ray and cursor: 16.
//   About tab in a room: no rows, so the room, the glow, both eyes, the
//     stats, the cog button, the panel, the clock, the ring on whichever of
//     its two buttons is under the ray, ray and cursor: 11.
//   The bar: the pill and all seven buttons (exit, gamepad, environment, cog,
//     keyboard, ray, 3D) over the glow, both eyes, the stats, ray and cursor:
//     14, and 14 in a room, where the pill gives way to the room's own layer.
//     15 with the toast. With the ray switched off it is one fewer, since the
//     bar is not a panel and brings no beam back. With the screen locked to
//     the head, outside a room, head aim's button is an eighth: 15, 16 with
//     the toast.
//   The controller models are a projection layer of their own, over the
//     picture and the panels and under the beam, one more on any of these
//     while a model shows: the bar to 15, 16 with the toast (16 and 17 with
//     head aim's button), the Display tab to 15 and the About tab to 12, and
//     the screen, 3D and Picture tabs to 17 and the Room tab to 18, which go
//     over, and the head locked screen tab to 20.
// So a frame over the runtime's limit sheds, in this order, the toast, the
// controller models, the hover ring, the cog button and the clock strip (see
// nativeEndFrame), which brings every case above to 16 or under with the
// toast up. The head locked screen tab at its fullest, models and toast
// included, is 21 and comes down to exactly 16; the head locked bar at its
// fullest is 17 and comes down to 16.
// Switching the 3D off only ever takes a layer away: both eyes are then one.
// The keyboard sheds the bar furniture and adds only its panel and one ring,
// so it comes to 9. The report sheet puts the settings panel away and brings
// the keyboard up under it, so it is the keyboard's 9 and its own sheet: 10.
// Each is one more with the controller models up.
// The exit prompt sheds the furniture too and adds its own sheet and the
// button that opened it, so it comes to less again. The hand lock hint is a
// modal the same way: it sheds the furniture and adds its sheet and the ring
// on the button under the ray, which takes the hover ring's slot and so goes
// with it, so the room, the glow, both eyes, the stats, the sheet, the ring,
// ray and cursor: 9, with the models and the toast 11. The Ko-fi sheet is the
// same again with the cog button kept up beside it: 10, 12 with both. A panel
// fading out keeps the bar furniture down until it has gone, and one opening
// cuts any other's fade short, so a fade never stacks two of these. The launch
// splash is two layers and all the frame carries while it is fully up; as it
// fades the room, the glow, the eyes and the stats come up under it, five
// more, with no furniture and no toast, since neither input nor notices move
// until it has gone.
// Sized well past all that anyway: an overflow here is a smashed stack, and
// the margin costs a few pointers.
